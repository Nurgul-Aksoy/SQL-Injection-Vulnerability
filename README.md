# SQL-Injection-Vulnerability
SQL Injection is a technique in which an attacker creates or modifies existing SQL commands to expose confidential data or invalidate valuable ones and even execute dangerous system-level commands on the database host. This is accomplished by the application that takes user input and combines it with static parameters to create a SQL query.
PERFORMING SQL ATTACKS
Commonly used payloads have been identified.

How Payload works?
SQL statements are embedded in the part where the application waits for user login information, if the content of the incoming data is not filtered within the application or is filtered incorrectly, it is seen that the payload is running without any error with the code embedded in the application.
