# SQL-Injection-Vulnerability
SQL Injection is a technique in which an attacker creates or modifies existing SQL commands to expose confidential data or invalidate valuable ones and even execute dangerous system-level commands on the database host. This is accomplished by the application that takes user input and combines it with static parameters to create a SQL query.
